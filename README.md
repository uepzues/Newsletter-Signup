# Newsletter-Signup
A newsletter signup form made using expressjs, javascript, sass, mailchimp API

This is a newsletter signup form web app where users enter their name and email address so you can email them if they are interested in your content/product.
The frontend was developed with HTML, SASS, and a bit of javascript for interactiveness.
The form containing the username and email address will be sent to the server. 
The backend was developed using Express.js and the Mailchimp Marketing API--used to store and manage the email subscription list.
If the process is successful the page will be redirected to the success page, else the user will be redirected to the fail page
with a button available to go back and check for errors and submit the form again.
